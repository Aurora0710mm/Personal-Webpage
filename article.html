        <h2>Books Management System (BMS)</h2>
        <p>
          The main content of this project is to simulate the school library
          management system. The purpose of the project is to realize the
          operation of the library management system through C++ and fully learn
          the class in C++ as well as the comprehensive use of knowledge. This
          involves calls that contain world time and calls to different
          functions for different functions. Through the project, I am
          proficient in data types, programming statements, function definitions
          ,and calls of high-level programming languages and modularization
          ideas.

        <h2>Mine Clearance</h2>
        <p>
          The main goal of the mine_clearance project was to fix the incomplete
          features and bugs of the old game. In addition, we also optimized the
          interface to make it more friendly. And this project uses python.game
          framework, updates and resets, and timings. Finally, solve the code
          comment problem. The main changes are intended to make the code more
          readable and easier to maintain later.

        <h2>Battle City</h2>
        <p>
          The main purpose of Battle City is to improve the game's features and
          code comments for later maintenance. It took a lot of effort to fix
          the messy code for this project. The main goal is to unify the
          annotation content and ensure that the annotation is universal. In
          particular, for the convenience of later optimization of the code has
          been added when the function can be faster to locate the code
          location.
