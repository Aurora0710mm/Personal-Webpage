          Hello! It's Min. I am enrolled in a 2+2 program between Portland State
          University and Changchun University of Technology. I would like to
          introduce my university in China. As you can see, the first two
          pictures are two different campuses of my university. Unlike American
          universities, we only have one campus. Different majors will study on
          different campuses. The third picture is our university dormitory. Our
          dormitory can live up to four people, and some dormitories can also
          live up to six people, depending on your major. Doesn't it sound
          weird? Our dormitory is only about 215 square feet, but 4-6 people
          live in it. Unlike American dormitories, most dorms in China do not
          have kitchens, bathrooms and living rooms.

          As for me, studying abroad is a challenging decision. It is the first
          time to come to study and live in a strange country. A few days before
          coming to the United States, I suffered from insomnia almost every
          day. I was extremely excited and nervous, worried about whether I
          could adapt to life abroad. I took a 13-hour flight from Beijing to
          San Francisco, then transferred to Portland. As soon as we got off the
          plane, a teacher would come to pick us up. At that time, I felt that I
          was not very alone. In the rest of my life, I also gradually adapted
          to my study and life in Portland. The teachers and classmates here are
          very enthusiastic, and I have a real sense of the local American
          culture. But with the arrival of new coronary pneumonia in 2020, my
          life has changed again. My parents in China worry about me every day,
          so I have to buy expensive air tickets to go back to China for online
          classes. Now I have been taking online classes in China for a year,
          but I miss my life in the United States every day. I long to return to
          the United States to live a normal campus life. I hope to travel to
          other cities in the United States. I used to experience the culture of
          different parts of the United States in movies, and I really liked the
          local people's love for freedom of life. I hope that the epidemic will
          end soon and I can realize my wish to travel in the United States
          sooner.
